# NeoPixels
## 1. Introduction  
  
In this project I will direct NeoPixels with a webserver.  
The NeoPixels uses the WS2812-chip and we'll direct it with a ESP-01 (ESP8266).

An ESP-01 module with a ESP8266 makes a WiFi-accesspoint. After you open the webpage on your smartphone you can choose between 44 different light effects for your LED's and 5 different brightnesses. The LED-strip may have a length from 1 to up 5 meters and can have 30, 60 or 140 LED's per meter.  
  
On request I'll make 2 different versions. One weaker version with an external power supply and one stronger version with an internal power supply.
